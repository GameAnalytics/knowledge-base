# android-store FAQ


## Integration

**Can I test android-store only on a device?**

When you want to test in-app purchases you will need to test on a device.

---

**What is the purpose of the "Soomla Secret" and can I change it after launching my game?**

The Soomla Secret is a special string of your choice that the framework uses for encrypting end device data. The rationale here is that you want all the users' balances to be stored securely to prevent malicious users from hacking the numbers.

You should choose this secret wisely and never change it! If you try to change it after you launch your game, old data from the database will become unavailable, meaning that your users will lose their balances.

---

**The prices of the products I want to sell should be set in Google Play, Amazon, etc. Then why does SOOMLA expect me to supply a price in the code?**

All SOOMLA items require you to provide price by design. The purpose of this is to support displaying of prices in situations of no internet connectivity where you can't query Google Play / Amazon.

The prices used for purchase are the Market Prices defined in Google Play or Amazon.

To get the updated market prices in your application use `MarketItemsRefreshFinishedEvent`:

``` cs
@Subscribe
public void onMarketItemsRefreshFinished(MarketItemsRefreshFinishedEvent marketItems) {
    // marketItems contains the updated market prices
}
```

**How can I test the products that I want to sell in Google Play?**

In testing mode, you should use [Google's test product IDs](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html#billing-testing-static). Please notice that you should use "android.test.purchased" for all the products you want to successfully test, and that you can use this same *test* product ID for more than one product. Once you are done with testing mode you can define your actual product IDs, as explained in our [Google Play IAB](/android/store/Store_GooglePlayIAB) tutorial.

**What jars do I need to have in my project?**

- AndroidStore.jar
- SoomlaAndroidCore.jar
- square-otto-1.3.2.jar

## General

**What's the difference between "item IDs" and "product IDs" that SOOMLA requires and can they have the same value?**

Item IDs are internal IDs that SOOMLA uses to identify ALL entities in the economy. Product IDs are IDs you need to provide for products that you want to sell in the market (Google Play, Amazon Appstore, etc.). These product IDs need to correspond exactly to what you define in the market.

So, every item in your implementation of `IStoreAssets` will have an item ID, and the items you are selling for money (PurchaseWithMarket) will also have product IDs.

An item's "item ID" and "product ID" can be the same, but its not recommended as it just creates a source of confusion for you.

**I have a `LifetimeVG` defined in my game that is available for purchase in the market. Why does this item still appear after I restart my app?**

`LifetimeVG`s that are defined in the market, are defined as non-consumable products. This means that once the user purchases this item, the market saves it for them forever.

The only way to delete this kind of item is to refund it in the market.

---

**How can I test purchases of `LifetimeVG`s that are defined in Google Play?**

For testing purposes, you will need to purchase the `LifetimeVG` and then return it in order to repurchase.

Because of the characteristics of `LifetimeVG`s (kept for him/her forever in the Market), the only way to purchase the same item a second time, is to refund the first purchase.

Instructions for how to refund items in Google Play:

1. Visit your merchant account through Google's Developer Console (there's a link under the "Financial Reports" tab).

2. Refund the test item. See Google's [Refund an order](https://support.google.com/wallet/business/answer/2741495?hl=en) instructions for how to do this.

3. Call `StoreInventory.takeVirtualItem("lifetimeVG_ID", 1)` to clear your local inventory.

Note that Google Play caches purchase statuses locally, so you may have to wait a few minutes for the cancellation to actually take place. If you don't want to wait, a faster option is to clear the cache of the "Google Play Store" app and your app manually, to force the non-consumable item refresh.

---

**If I make changes to the products I have defined in Google Play or Amazon, how can I see the updated information in my code?**

Use [SoomlaStore](https://github.com/soomla/unity3d-store/blob/master/Soomla/Assets/Plugins/Soomla/Store/SoomlaStore.cs)'s function `refreshMarketItemsDetails` to query the store for the details for all of the game's market items by product IDs. This operation will "fill" up the `MarketItem` objects with the information you provided in the Google Play or Amazon developer console including: localized prices, title and description.

---

**Are user purchases synced across various devices?**

Purchases you make with coins \ other virtual items, are not synced across devices, however, we are planning to add this functionality in the future. Regarding restoring transactions that were bought with real money in Google Play, are associated per user. Thus they should be available on other devices with the same account and app.

From Google's IAB docs:

> Managed in-app products are items that have their ownership information tracked and managed by Google Play. When a user purchases a managed in-app item, Google Play stores the purchase information for each item on a per-user basis. This enables you to later query Google Play at any time to restore the state of the items a specific user has purchased. This information is persistent on the Google Play servers even if the user uninstalls the application or if they change devices."

## Common Errors

**I updated the names of some of the items in my implementation of `IStoreAssets`. Strangely, when I try to buy the items with the new names, I get a `VirtualItemNotFoundException`, but when I try to purchase the items with their old names, everything works fine. What's going on?**

When you ran the app for the first time, it saves your assets to the internal DB. In subsequent runs, the Store module loads the assets from the DB, disregarding the assets you passed in the init arguments. UNLESS, you increase the [version of your assets](https://github.com/soomla/android-store/blob/master/SoomlaAndroidExample/src/com/soomla/example/MuffinRushAssets.java#L46), in which case it overrides the assets saved in the DB.

So you can either do the above, or you can delete the app from your device (thus deleting the internal DB) and install again.

**I am getting the error "Canâ€™t run the java command. Add your JDK folder to the PATH environment variable". What does this mean?**

If you are using Windows, this is a known bug in Windows that you can just ignore and everything will work fine.

---

**When I try to test a purchase after publishing my app on Google Play I get the error message: "The item you were attempting to purchase couldn't be found".**

You need to define your item's product ID exactly the same in Google Play developer console and in your code. If not, you will get this error.

The other case where you will get such an error, is when you haven't waited long enough after publishing your game on Google Play. After publishing the game (to alpha or beta) you must wait a few hours (about 1-2 hours) until you can test your in-app products.

---

**When I try to test purchase my in-app product IDs (real product IDs, not Google's static response IDs), I get the following Google Play error: "This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play".**

Follow the checklist below and/or read Google's [Testing In-app Billing](http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_testing.html) document.

- Make sure your APK is built in release mode (exported / signed with release certificate).

- Wait for a few hours (anywhere between 5 to 24 hours) after uploading signed APK with correct version code.

- Publish uploaded / signed APK to either alpha / beta / production channel (NOT draft).

- This APK is what needs to be installed on your device; not run directly through Eclipse on your device.

- You cannot install this APK with your Google account tied to your Google Play Developer console account, being used for developing the app / game, as a developer is not allowed to buy anything from their own account. Use a separate test Google account.

- Make sure this test Google account is added to your Google Play Developer Console (within the Settings screen, "License Testing" section).

- The test Google account needs to be your primary Google account on the test device prior to installing the APK on the device (safest way to do this is to remove your developer Google account from your phone, and add it back again after your testing is done; that way you only have one Google account tied to your test device).
