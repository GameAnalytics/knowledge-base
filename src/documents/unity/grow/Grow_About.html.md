## About

Soomla GROW is our flagship community-driven analytics dashboard. Developers using GROW can gain valuable insights about their games' performance and compare the data to benchmarks of other games in the GROW community.

GROW analytics uses all of Soomla's modules: [Store](/unity/store/), [Profile](/unity/profile/) and [LevelUp](/unity/levelup/). You may choose to use only specific modules, however, to benefit from the full power of GROW analytics we recommend that you integrate all three.

To get started with GROW, please follow our [Getting Started tutorial](/unity/grow/Grow_GettingStarted) for Unity.

### Why use GROW?

- With GROW, you can see how you're app is doing in a number of different aspects, including average revenue, average session duration, what percentage of your users are social in your game, and more. These are all explained in detail in the section below.

- GROW is different than other analytics services because it allows data sharing. In the dashboard, you'll be able to see statistics about other developers' apps as well as your own. This feature makes it possible for you to **compare your game to other indie games** and see how you measure.

## Breakdown of the GROW Dashboard

The [GROW dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la) consists of several screens where you can see different information.

### Main Page

- **ACTIVE USERS** - See how many active users your game has and filter by time (today, last week, last month, or all time).

- **GAME EVENTS** - See how many events have been fired in your game and filter by time (today, last week, last month, or all time).

<br>

<div class="info-box">In the following screens of the dashboard, each statistic represents some type of information about your game, while under each of these there's another statistic in blue, which represents the information about all the other games using GROW. Also notice the color coding: Green means that your statistic is better than or equal to the others' statistic. Yellow means that you're a bit behind, and red means you're far behind.</div>

### Overview

In this part of the dashboard, you can filter by Date, Country, and Device. At the time of writing this article, the Benchmark filter is not yet available, but once it comes out, you'll be able to compare how your users behave in other games.

#### **NUMBERS:**

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/overviewNumbers.png "Numbers")

- **ARPU** - Average Revenue Per User
	For example, if you have 100 users, and only 1 of them paid $1.00, your ARPU will be $1.00 / 100 users = **$0.01**.

- **ARPPU** - Average Revenue Per **Paying** User
	Following the example above, you have 1 paying user that paid $1.00, so your ARPPU will be $1.00 / 1 user = **$1.00**

- **TIMES PLAYED** - The average number of times your game has been played.

- **SESSION DURATION** - The average session duration.

<br>

#### **CONVERSION:**

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/overviewConversion.png "Conversion")

This shows what percentage of your users make purchases in your game, rated your game, or connect with social networks, all according to the filters you chose at the top. For example, you can see that 1.8% of your users rated your game according to the filters chosen (All time, All countries, All devices). In comparison to the others, you're doing great, because the comparison statistic is 1.4%.

### Countries & Devices

In this part of the dashboard, you can filter by Date and Conversion action, which can be Social, Rating, or Purchase.

<br>

#### **COUNTRIES:**

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/countries.png "Countries")

  Hover over any country on the map and see what percentage of your users in that country performed the action you defined in the filter. For example, in the image above, you can see that 4.1% of your **US users** that played **yesterday** performed a **social** action in your game (like, post status, etc.). You can see how you compare to other games that use GROW - with .
the same filters, the other games together have 6.0% for this statistic, which means you're not doing very well in comparison, but not horribly either.  

<br>

#### **DEVICES:**

  ![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/devices.png "Devices")

  See the percentage of your users who performed the action you defined in the filter per device. For example, 4.5% of your iPhone users rated your game. 6.2% of the other games' iPhone users rated their games.
